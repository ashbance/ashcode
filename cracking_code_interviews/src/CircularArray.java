 * A zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers is given. Rotation of the array means that each
 * element is shifted right by one index, and the last element of the array is also moved to the first place.

 For example, the rotation of array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] is [6, 3, 8, 9, 7]. The goal is to rotate array A K times; that is,
 each element of A will be shifted to the right by K indexes.

 Write a function:

 class Solution { public int[] solution(int[] A, int K); }
 that, given a zero-indexed array A consisting of N integers and an integer K, returns the array A rotated K times.

 For example, given array A = [3, 8, 9, 7, 6] and K = 3, the function should return [9, 7, 6, 3, 8].

 Assume that:

 N and K are integers within the range [0..100];
 each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000..1,000].
 In your solution, focus on correctness. The performance of your solution will not be the focus of the assessment.
